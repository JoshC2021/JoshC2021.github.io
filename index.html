        <h2>Blogging</h2>
        <p>The key to having a succesful day means developing a routine. People are habitual and are prone 
        to develop habits. By instilling positive habits into a dialy routine, it becomes easier for you to
        continue those good practives and avoid negative habits. Also a routine helps you plan ahead and breakdown your
        day as you know in advance what you need to do. So start planning now to continue generating success.</p>
        <h2>Developing</h2>
        <p>Becoming a developer takes a lot of practice. I began in high school taking a course in Java. After
        getting a taste for it, I engendered a great interest in programming and took a lot of courses in college.
        The material covered a wide range of courses from web development to AI. Following my graduation, I would
        spend time doing Freelancing to bolster my portfolio. This leads me to today where I am enrolled at 
        the Grand Circus to learn about c# and developing code in a professional manner.</p>
        <h2>Hometown</h2>
        <p>I was raised in the city of Novi,Michigan. Its name rumored to come from No. VI(Roman Numeral 6) due 
        to Novi being the 6th Toll Gate. The city is home to Twelve Oaks Mall which has a load of stores to go to.
        Ease of travel due to the abundance of major freeways including M-5,I-275,I-696, and I-96 means menas your
        free to come anytime.</p>
