        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>The Following consists of 2 links to different projects on my GitHub. The first is the
        first project I put online  prior to Grand Circus and the second one is the midterm.
        I included these two projects to help show the growth that I have gone through as
        a programmer so far through the program</p>

        <h2>Deliverable 1</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/JoshC2021/Deliverable1">First Project</a>
        <p>Program was a designed to get a valid password from the user
        through the console. Uses the Linq class to perform checks on the
        user input.</p>

        <h2>Midterm</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/JoshC2021/GC_Fitness_24">Halfway</a>
        <p>Program was meant to simulate the software that a staff member at
        a gym would use to manage their members. Creates several classes to modulate
        functions and stores member's info into a text file to not lose data</p>
